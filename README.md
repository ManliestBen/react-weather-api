# React-Weather-API

## This app uses the openweathermap.com API to fetch weather data for a city and display it on the page.

## This app also demonstrates how to use the back end server to make API calls, and requires a .env file to locally store the API key obtained from registering (for free) [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## The API key should be stored as follows in the .env file:
```
API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
